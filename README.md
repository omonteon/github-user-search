## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project helped me understand CSS grid better. While I'm not an expert yet, I certainly understand better how to build layouts using CSS Grid.
I also learned how to use SVGR, to import svg files in a React project and still be able to style the svg.
Finally, I did some e2e tests using Cypress.

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning about CSS grid, accessibility and testing.

### Useful resources

- [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/) - This helped me to import svg files easily in the project.
- [Learn CSS GRID](https://scrimba.com/learn/cssgrid) - This Scrimba course helped me understand CSS grid better.
